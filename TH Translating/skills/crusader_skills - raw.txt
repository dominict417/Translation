Well, I'm Leslie Ford, commander of the Prontera Crusader Guardians. We're charged with the duty of protecting adventurers and citizens from evil monsters.

There's been a recent surge in unprovoked violence from Goblins and they're making quite a bit of trouble for us. Our patrols are supposed to report on their activity to me.

However, today's report hasn't arrived yet, so I'm starting to fear that something has happened to the patrol. Unfortunately, my duties don't allow me to leave my post.

I'm getting desperate, and I don't have any choice but to ask for outside help. Since you're a fellow Crusader, I want to ask you if you would please lend me your aid.
