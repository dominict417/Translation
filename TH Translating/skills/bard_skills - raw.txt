Hmmm... Maybe. Maybe all of you Bards and Minstrels aren't that bad. But I can never forget what that Bard did to me...
next;
[Timid Young Man]
It all started when I was traveling through Umbala and met a strange Bard who was studying under the tutelage of Puchuchartan, the Utan Shaman of the village.
next;
[Timid Young Man]
That Bard and I got along fairly well until he took me to Umbala's Bungee Jump. He insisted that I jump at least once for the ''full Umbala experience.'' I refused, seeing as they don't use bungees.
next;
[Timid Young Man]
The Bard seemed offended and claimed it was perfectly safe, and that only a few people have died by jumping. Then, he just... He gave me this intense look.
next;
[Timid Young Man]
His eyes seemed so full of rage! I remember him mumbling something, and all of a sudden, I lost control of my body! My arms and legs were just moving on their own!
next;
[Timid Young Man]
Before long, I found myself struggling to keep myself from leaping off that Bungee Jump. But the more I resisted, the more violently I'd flail toward the edge. It was horrible!
next;
[Timid Young Man]
That was the most terrifying experience of my life! It was bad enough that I risked my life, but that feeling of not having any control over your body is so overwhelming!
next;
[" + strcharinfo(PC_NAME) + "]
Wait, you're saying a Bard did this to you? I've never heard of a song or skill with that sort of effect before. That's really strange...
next;
[Timid Young Man]
Well, I've never heard of that sort of power up until I had to experience it for myself. Oh, I can still see that evil smile of his in my nightmares...
next;

Anyway, thanks for that drink, it really helped me settle my nerves. But I must warn you not to look for that strange Bard. I'm sure he's really some sort of demon or something...
