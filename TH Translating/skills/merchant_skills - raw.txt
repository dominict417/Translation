Eh... ok.
Pooooh...

case 3:
[Necko]
Crazy Uproar uses your loud voice
to boost battle spirit
With 8 SP, you get an additional
4 STR for 5 minutes!!!!!
If you use it repeatedly
it is 5 minutes from that point on.
next;
[Necko]
Stay casual in everyday life,
and when you need to fight
it will gather your spirit.
Very useful, I must say!!!!
close;

[Necko]
Oh, were you charmed 
by my voice?
Indeed, my voice is loud!
You can hear it from so far away.
And also.

My voice isn't JUST loud!
I have learned the skill
that lets me shout..
The Crazy Uproar skill!
next;
[Necko]
Crazy Uproar uses your loud voice
to boost battle spirit
With 8 sp, you get an additional
4 STR for 5 minutes!!!!!
If you use it repeatedly
it is 5 minutes from that point.
next;
[Necko]
Stay casual in everyday life,
but shout to gather more
strength when you fight.
It is very useful!!!!
To learn this skill, you first need
to learn the essentials of sound!!!
next;
[Necko]
You can learn this in Payon
from a singer with just a loud voice
You can take lessons from him!
next;
[Necko]
But that person died!
So you can't learn it anymore!
Hahahahahahahaha!!!!
..............................
...Aww you look disappointed?
Do you want to learn Crazy Uproar?
next;
[Necko]
Hmm... Shall I teach you?
If you really want it, that is.
First, I must scorch the vocal cords.
There are some things needed to do so.
next;
[Necko]
7 Pearls, 1 bottle of Banana Juice,
and 50 mushroom spores!
Then I'll scorch your vocal chord!
next;
[Necko]
See you when you are ready!

Mmm? I was wondering who was making all
the raucus carrying around a cart.
It was you.
Yes, I remember you.
what do you think? The new cart..good, yeah?
next;
[Charlron]
Enjoy life.
Life isn't just simply moving
forward..Slowly, looking around,
dragging a heavy cart is
the way us merchants live.
Then see you next time.

Be healthy~

Congratulations.
You can choose a cart
according to your taste.
And now you don't even need
me to help you. All you
need is some SP.
next;
[Charlron]
Convenient, don't you think?
Oh and one more thing!
Each time you level, you can
have a new different cart
So work hard.
next;
[Charlron]
But anyways, it looks very nice on you!
Hahaha! Have a nice day!

Mmm... It's true that I
change carts but...
In order to do so, I need
some materials to use.
next;
[Charlron]
50 Trunks.
10 Iron.
20 Animal Skins.
I need at least these things
to change your cart.
next;
[Charlron]
So come see me when you
have prepared everything.
close;
case 2:
[Charlron]
Oh no, you don't know at all?(changes tone)
A new way to show off a merchant's ego!
An expression of an excellent brain!
Change Cart is a skill that
makes a merchant stand out!
next;
[Charlron]
A fun skill that allows you to
use a cart according to your
level with only 40 SP!
next;
[Charlron]
That is Change Cart!
A basic skill for any merchant.
I'll teach you how to make
one so watch carefully, and
do exactly what I do to make
your own in the future!
next;
[Charlron]
But, since it's the first time
you need to prepare some materials.
50 Trunks!
10 Iron!
20 Animal skins!
-bring these please!
next;
[Charlron]
All we have to do is
make one using those materials,
so come back when you are ready.
Ok?

Welcome young one.
Is selling fun? I am the
merchant Charlron. I have been
doing some research about.
carts recently.
next;
[Charlron]
Aren't you tired of that cart?
Come to me if you want to
change your cart. I'll do a good job.
But, there are some conditions.
next;
[Charlron]
I'm a pretty famous merchant,
so I don't really deal with beginners.
Once you are level 30
I may consider establishing
a deal with you.
close;

I am a merchant that
deals with many things, Charlron.
If you ever find anything interesting
come back and try to 
negotiate a deal with me.

[Gershaun]
... you don't seem to know
about Cart Revolution.
Ok, I'll tell you a story
I've never told anyone before.
Listen carefully.
next;
[Gershaun]
I did research about a different
way to use the cart.
I tried cooking ramen
and even tried jump-roping.
But none of them were able
to satisfy me.
next;
[Gershaun]
In despair, I wandered
through the fields with my cart.
After wandering dazed day after day..
I met a very strong monster.
Life was in danger!
Why me - a weaponless, armor-less merchant!
next;
[Gershaun]
I was scared to death.. thinking
and hoping that this wasn't the
last of me. With little hope left
I tried the last thing possible.
I used my cart to hit the monster!
next;
[Gershaun]
The monster died in one hit.
It was then that I realized something.
Carts can become weapons, too!
I finally realized that we can
attack with carts!
next;
[Gershaun]
Cart Revolution!
That's the new attack skill I developed.
Using 12 SP you lift your cart
to hit your opponent..
right in the head!
next;
[Gershaun]
The heavier your cart is, the
stronger you can attack! With one hit,
your opponent will be hurt and
forced to back off!
This is Cart Revolution!
close;

Mmm, a young merchant.
You must use carts, too.
Since you need to do business.
But is that all?
