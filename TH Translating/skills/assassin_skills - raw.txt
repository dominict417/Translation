Ah yes, that's why you look so familiar. You're of those to whom I've taught the ^990099Venom Knife^000000 skill. So, what brings you to me this time?
next;
[Killtin]
What's that...?! You want me to teach it to you once again? It's a shame you've forgotten, but I suppose it can't be helped. Alright, alright, I'll teach you.
next;
[Killtin]
First, you need to equip a Knife class weapon, and then cast Envenom on your knife. Throwing the blade? That's all in the wrist. Now, watch me closely and take note.
next;
[Killtin]
You see? Having good form is essential to performing flawless technique. Always basics before the specifics. Now, why don't you give it a try?

[Killtin]
Hm? Ah, you're definitely a member of the Assassin Guild. Great, you've come just at the right time.
next;
[Killtin]
Our guildmaster recently succeeded in developing two new skills for Assassins. I've been charged with the task of teaching these new skills to all the members of our guild.
next;
select("New skills?");
[Killtin]
That's right, "+ strcharinfo(PC_NAME) +". The first skill specifically enhances the Sonic Blow skill, and the second skill is a long range attack that's named ''^990099Venom Knife^000000.''
next;
[Killtin]
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me about any of these new skills. It's my job to teach you as much as I can about them.
next;
while(1) {
switch(select("^0000FFSonic Blow Enhancement^000000", "^990099Venom Knife^000000", "Continue Conversation")) {
case 1:
[Killtin]
If you've been an Assassin for a while, then you must be familiar with the Sonic Blow skill, which inflicts 8 powerful strikes at an enemy in one blindingly fast attack.
next;
[Killtin]
However, due to the speed involved in that skill, Sonic Blow isn't as accurate as it can be. After years of testing and research, our guildmaster developed a way to fix this.
next;
[Killtin]
He created a new skill named ''Sonic Acceleration'' that Assassins can cast on themselves in order to quickly detect and accurately strike the target's fatal points.
next;
[Killtin]
In effect, Sonic Acceleration roughly doubles the damage that you can inflict with the Sonic Blow. If you use Sonic Blow pretty often, then this skill will be pretty useful.
next;
[Killtin]
I suggest that you learn the Venom Knife skill from me first. Then, you can talk to Esmille, the beautiful Assassin Cross right next to me, to learn Sonic Acceleration.
next;
break;
case 2:
[Killtin]
As you may well know, our job isn't really known for its long range attacks. Sure, we can use Bows, and we've got a few long distance skills, but their uses are kind of limited.
next;
[Killtin]
This Venom Knife skill was developed with this weakness in long range attacking in mind. Basically, we use the Envenom skill on a knife and throw it at a distant enemy to poison them.
next;
break;
case 3:
[Killtin]
Now, if you like, I can teach you the ^009900Venom Knife^000000 skill right now. It won't take that much time, so what do you say? You ready to learn?

If you're familiar with Sonic Blow, you'll know that it's difficult to inflict fatal damage with that skill. It's far too fast to be able to attack very accurately...

However, by learning Sonic Acceleration, you can overcome this accuracy drawback and fulfill the full damage potential of the Sonic Blow skill.
