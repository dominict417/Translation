Ah, it must be grand to be an adventuring Knight in this world. You must have encountered all sorts of dangerous monsters and fearsome enemies, right?

I'm almost jealous of all the great experiences that you must be having. Someday, you'll have to tell me your own stories of bravery.

Ah, I see that you've made tremendous progress in your pursuit of strength. Transcendance is no small feat, and it is a great honor to achieve Lord Knight rank.
next;
[Essofeit]
However, I'm aware of the drawback of memory erasure. Therefore, I assume you're here to learn the Charge Attack skill once more. It will be my pleasure to instruct you again.
next;
[Essofeit]
Charge Attack is an active skill that consumes 40 SP to damage one target. If you're further from the target, you'll increase the skill's damage and the delay before damage is inflicted.
next;
[Essofeit]
During this delay, you will be immobilized. Therefore, the cost of increased damage is greater risk to yourself. For now, it would be best to practice this skill on your own.

Good luck on your adventures, Lord Knight. I'm sure you'll make good use of the Charge Attack and bring pride to the Prontera Chivalry.

I've named this skill, ''Charge Attack.'' It's not a fancy name, but it's simple and direct enough for you to understand how it works. Now let me teach it to you...
next;
[Essofeit]
Charge Attack is an active skill that consumes 40 SP to damage one target. If you're further from the target, you'll increase the skill's damage and the delay before damage is inflicted.

The concept of honor seems to be lost on today's Knights. No longer do they appreciate the meaning of the word ''chivalry'' or the noble pursuit for strength...
next;
[Essofeit]
Back in my day, Knights were strong enough to get at least 5 Candy Canes and 3 Witherless Roses through hunting alone! But Knights these days have grown soft...

There are still Knights out there who believe in honorably risking our lives to achieve true strength...

You... You really understand. You truly know the value of hardship. It makes me glad to see that a true Knight like you still exists.
next;
[Essofeit]
Hahaha, finally, I've found someone I can call a true comrade. We're the last of a dying breed if you hadn't noticed, my friend. But there is hope for Knights...
next;
[Essofeit]
It's decided, then. As long as we live, chivalry will never die! Thanks to you, my faith in the Knighthood has been rekindled.
next;
[Essofeit]
In my recognition of you as a true Knight, I will teach you a special skill that I've been researching recently. Why don't you come back after I've completed the preparations?

It's shameful... Most new recruits into the Prontera Chivalry are more concerned about their pensions than their honor!

[Essofeit]
Maybe I'm romanticizing the past, but I don't agree with all the bureaucracy that is present today in the Prontera Chivalry.

Although, I admit that I was a lot happier back when honor was all you needed. Nowadays, it  seems like anyone can be a Knight. Er, no offense~

So you've seen the Knights of the 7th Division for what they really are, eh? As a fellow Knight, you may understand my feelings of disappointment.
next;
[Essofeit]
It's so disheartening... I don't why we're Knights or what we're training for. When I was your age, well, I wanted to risk my life and achieve true strength. 
next;
[Essofeit]
But... I'm sure that you don't want to hear an old man's tall tales. All those wonderful battles, that glorious camaraderie forged between rivals... It's all in the past.
next;
KNGT_SK = 7;

Maybe it's better that I forget all about my old fashioned ideals. I guess times have changed, and that my idea of chivalry may be dead.

Hm, why don't take a tour of the 7th Division and see the attitude of my comrades for yourself? You'll see Grand Master Maroujje training the recruits outside.

Greetings. I am Essofeit Lageiya of the 7th Division of the Prontera Chivalry. As a proud Knight upholding the principles of honor and chivalry, I am at your service.
next;
[Essofeit]
May I ask which division you are from? Ah, you're a Knight that's been granted royal permisson to journey as you please. That must be great, the freedom you have.
next;
[Essofeit]
Sadly, the Division of which I am member is too bureaucratic. I believe that my comrades are more concerned with their pensions than with chivalry, or defending the weak.
next;
[Essofeit]
Even if we wanted to be more active, there are too many regulations that hamper the good we can do. Over time, the situation has grown much worse. But don't take my word...
next;
[Essofeit]
Perhaps it will be better if you visited the 7th Division for yourself and speak to the other Knights that are training. Hopefully, you will see what I have seen for a long time...

I guess we're more like government employees than actual Knights. We're overpaid, and don't really have to do anything other than pretend to train.

Me? I plan on milking the system for all it's worth. Work here a few years, then live the rest of my life on a fat pension. Yeah, that's gonna be great.

Gosh, I'm sick and tired of him talking about Knighthood. Essofeit insists that all Knights, even complete rookies, should be able to obtain 5 Candy Canes and 3 Witherless Roses from hunting.

Hell, I just hate to hear his preaching about his great experiences fighting monsters. But now Essofeit just researches stuff inside the building and doesn't do much else...

Man, Knight training is pretty rough. Don't they know that I'm far too delicate for all this strenuous activity?

Ah well, if I ever go down in battle, I won't be too surprised, seeing as I'm one of the weakest guys here. But when it happens, I'll be too busy looking good.
