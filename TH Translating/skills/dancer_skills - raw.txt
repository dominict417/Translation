It's well known that we must be beautiful to captivate those who watch us dance. But to rely on just our outward appearance is a ghastly waste of our full potential as performers.
next;
[Canell]
Yes, I can tell that you don't quite understand that the correct frame of mind is an essential element to true beauty. Now tell me, are you confident in your dancing...?
next;
if (select("Of course, old crone!", "I... I'm not sure...") == 1) {

Ho-ho~ I believe you've confused confidence with arrogance! The naive cannot tell there's a vitally important distinction between the two. Now... Prepare for punishment!

Awareness of your own flaws and faults is the first crucial step towards improvement. Yet your obvious neglect of your gift of dancing is... grounds for punishment!

Ho-ho~! Fortunately for you, I will teach you what you must learn to rise above your current limitations. When I'm finished with you, angels and demons won't resist your charms~

So... You still haven't mastered the fine art of exuding charm and humility! There must be consequences for this blatant affront to our profession! Prepare yourself!

Ho-ho~ It's good that you recognize that you have much to learn. Well, let's not waste any time. Your first lesson will be on image training and self visualization. Now, for that...

me ^FF00001 Crystal Mirror^000000! This tool is imperative to the lesson, so fetch it and bring it to me quickly!

Finally, you've come with the mirror. Now, look deeply and scrutinize your reflection. Gaze upon each blemish and fault, each charming trait of your face.

No face is perfect, but  know that your face is yours alone, and that it is what gives you a beauty that can be no one else's. Now, repeat these truisms after me...

Yes, the first and most important step to becoming beautiful is to realize and accept your gorgeousness. Confidence first, then beauty. Never the other way around.

[Canell]
Now that you've established the proper attitude on beauty, it's time for you to learn an advanced technique of- shall we say- enticement. I know an expert that I highly recommend.
next;
[Canell]
Go and find my sister in Prontera Chruch. If you mention me by name, she should be willing to teach you. I'd do it myself, but I need to enjoy my new Crystal Mirror~

keep your mirror.^000000

Actually, I only learned about winks, but not so much as how to do them. She... She got drunk and couldn't teach me more.

Oh, I should have known this would happen. Oh, well, I guess there's no way around it now. But you should know that gettng my sister drunk... is punishable.

Alright, the secret to proper winking is to allow your eyelid to seductively move to a natural rhythm. Close your eye for a second, then open it slowly to this count.

Now that you've mastered the art of winking, you. should know that you cannot allure those who are much stronger than you. So your winks won't work on everyone.

Of course, my winks don't have that drawback. Ho-ho~ Anyway, it's time for us to part now. I hope that you grow to become a more glamorous and charming dancer in days to come.
